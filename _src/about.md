# About

As you might have already guessed my name is Aninus Partikler, I'm a so called hobbist programmer and failure.
I like making stuff, but my programming knowledge is not really the best.

## My current setup

Here's a cool table:

::: responsive-table

| Device    | Name | Operating System | Version |
|-----------|------|------------------|---------|
| Laptop    |      |                  |         |   
| Phone     |      |                  |         | 
| Earphones |      |                  |         |

a lot since its first inception, and I hope that I can make it better and improve my skills.
